# Advent of Code

Solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)(AoC) progamming puzzles.
Each year contains 25
days, each with 2 puzzles which get progressively harder.

So far this repository contains:

- 2025 c++
- 2024 day 1 c++

To run the puzzle code you will need an input file. The author or AoC asked to not 
share the puzzle inputs. So to run you will need to gather your own inputs from the 
website. Create a new folder for the day you wish to run called `input` and name your input file
`input.txt` and place it in the input folder.
