# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) programming puzzles.

Advent of Code is an annual event consisting of 25 days, with two puzzles per day that gradually increase in difficulty.

## Repository Contents

Currently, this repository includes:

- 2025 — C++ solutions
- 2024 — Day 1 (C++)

## Running the Solutions

Each puzzle requires an input file. Per the request of the Advent of Code authors, puzzle inputs are not shared in this repository.

To run a solution:

1. Obtain your personal input from the Advent of Code website.
2. In the folder for the day you want to run, create a directory named `input`.
3. Place your input file inside that directory and name it `input.txt`.

Once the input file is in place, you can compile and run the corresponding solution.
